2. Walking up the directory tree within your workspace
3. Finding the nearest `package.json` file
4. Respecting workspace boundaries to avoid conflicts

- **Dependency Management**: Fast access to package.json files for dependency updates
- **Build Script Access**: Quickly open terminals in the right package directory
- **Path References**: Copy package paths for documentation or configuration files
- **Package Information**: Access package names for CLI commands or documentation
